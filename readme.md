# Twitter-Like Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This project implements a Twitter-like recommendation system. It uses a microservices architecture with a focus on graph-based recommendations. The system suggests hashtags and users to follow based on user tweets and sentiments.
### Key Features
- Post and view tweets.
- Get recommendations based on user activity and sentiment analysis.
- Perform sentiment analysis on tweets.
- Microservices-based architecture for scalability and maintainability.
## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Neo4j
- MongoDB
- Kafka
- Apache Spark (for Spark Streaming)
### Installation
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
2. Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python packages:
cd your-repo
pip install -r requirements.txt
### Configuration
- Update the configuration files under the `config/` directory with your database and Kafka cluster details.
- Set environment variables for sensitive information like database passwords.
### Running the Application
1. Start the Neo4j and MongoDB databases, and ensure Kafka and Spark Streaming are running.
2. Run the microservices:
python -m web_application.app
## Usage
- Access the web application at `http://localhost:5004`.
- Post tweets, and view recommendations and sentiment analysis results.
## Running the Tests
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.
### Break down into end-to-end tests
Describe what these tests test and why.
### And coding style tests
Explain what these tests test and why
## Deployment
