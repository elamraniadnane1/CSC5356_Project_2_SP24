# -----Twitter-Like Recommendation System-----
![Uploading image.pngâ€¦]()

## Project Overview
This project implements a Twitter-like recommendation system. It uses a microservices architecture with a focus on graph-based recommendations. The system suggests hashtags and users to follow based on user tweets and sentiments.
### Key Features
- Post and view tweets.
- Get recommendations based on user activity and sentiment analysis.
- Perform sentiment analysis on tweets.
- Microservices-based architecture for scalability and maintainability.
## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10
- Neo4j
- MongoDB
- Kafka
- NPM
- React.js / Node.js Framework
- Apache Spark (for Spark Streaming)
- Neo4j, Mongo DB Connectors
- Docker Container
### Installation
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/elamraniadnane1/Project_3.git
2. Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python packages:
cd Project_3
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running the Application
1. Start the Neo4j and MongoDB databases (in a cloud), and ensure Kafka and Spark Streaming are running and Docker as well.
2. Install all the requirements
3. Run the microservices
For more details please consult the official report & the video
## Usage
- Access the web application at `http://localhost:PORT`. The port depend on the local cfg of each user.
- Post tweets, and view recommendations and sentiment analysis results.

## Built With
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - The web framework used.
- [React.js](https://react.dev/) - Another front-end framework
- [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) - Graph database.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Document database.
- [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) - Streaming platform.
- [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) - Unified analytics engine.
